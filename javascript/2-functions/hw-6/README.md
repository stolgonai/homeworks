### Challenge Question: String Manipulation

If you feel comfortable with the other exercises, it's time to expand your knowledge! These puzzles involve manipulating strings; to try them out, you'll need to use some of the [built-in JavaScript methods for strings](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp). Methods are pre-written functions that are built into the language.

These questions are not as straightforward as the others. They challenge you to really think like a programmer. Really try to solve them before you peek at the answer.

### FixStart

Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with '\*', except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:

```
fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'
fixStart('turtle'): 'tur*le'
```
