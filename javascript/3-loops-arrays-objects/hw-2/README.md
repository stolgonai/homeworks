### 2. Top Choice

Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever). For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."

Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is. [The method slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice) might be helpful here.
